![alt text](https://github.com/nehakushwahaeaton/GacWmsIntegration/blob/main/Architecture_Flow_Diagarm.png?raw=true)
The GAC WMS Integration System connects different systems to GAC's Warehouse Management System (WMS). It handles both real-time data from modern ERP systems and scheduled data from older systems that use files.

## Components
### External Systems:
- **ERP Systems:** These are modern systems that send data like customer info, products, purchase orders, and sales orders directly to our system through APIs.   
- **Legacy Systems:** These are older systems that generate XML files with data and place them in specific folders for our system to pick up.
- **External Client Applications:** These are third-party apps that use our system's APIs to interact with the warehouse data.

### Integration Components:
- **Web API:** This is the part of our system that receives real-time data from ERP systems through APIs. It validates the data and sends it to the core services for processing.
- **File Processor:** This component regularly checks folders for new XML files from legacy systems, reads and processes these files, and sends the data to the core services.
- **Core Services:** These are the brains of our system. They handle all the business logic, like validating data and coordinating between different parts of the system.
- **Data Access:** This part manages how data is stored and retrieved from the database. It ensures data is saved correctly and efficiently.
- **WMS Client:** This component communicates with the GAC WMS, sending the processed data to the warehouse system and handling any responses.

### Target Systems:
- **SQL Server Database:** This is where all the data is stored, including customer info, products, orders, and logs.
- **GAC Warehouse Management System (WMS):** This is the final destination for the data. It manages warehouse operations based on the data it receives.

- Legacy systems generate XML files and place them in specific folders.
- The .NET File Processor detects new files, reads and processes them.
- The processed data is sent to the core services for validation and business logic.
- The data is saved to the SQL Server database and sent to the GAC WMS by the .NET WMS Client.

#### Client Application Flow:
<img src="https://github.com/nehakushwahaeaton/GacWmsIntegration/blob/main/ClientApplicationFlow.png" width="400" height="900">

# Project Structure and Design Patterns
The GAC WMS Integration project demonstrates a well-organized architecture that follows several key software design principles and patterns:

### 1. Clean Architecture
The project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- Core Layer (GacWmsIntegration.Core): Contains domain models, interfaces, and business logic
- Infrastructure Layer (GacWmsIntegration.Infrastructure): Handles data access and external dependencies
- Presentation Layer (GacWmsIntegration): API controllers and DTOs
- File Processing Layer (GacWmsIntegration.FileProcessor): Specialized component for file-based integration

This layered approach ensures that business rules are isolated from external concerns like UI and databases, making the system more maintainable and testable.

### 2. Dependency Injection
The project uses dependency injection extensively:

DependencyInjection.cs in the Infrastructure project centralizes service registration
Services are accessed through interfaces rather than concrete implementations
This facilitates loose coupling and makes the system more testable
### 3. Repository Pattern
While not explicitly named, the project likely implements the Repository pattern through:

ApplicationDbContext serving as the data access layer
IApplicationDbContext interface abstracting database operations
Service classes that use the context to perform CRUD operations
### 4. Service Pattern
The project implements the Service pattern for business logic:

CustomerService, ProductService, etc. encapsulate business rules
Services are accessed through interfaces (ICustomerService, etc.)
This centralizes business logic and separates it from controllers
### 5. DTO Pattern
The project uses Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to:

Decouple the API contract from internal domain models
Control what data is exposed through the API
Validate input data before processing
## SOLID Principles Application
#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each service class has a single responsibility (e.g., ProductService handles only product-related operations)
Controllers are focused on HTTP request/response handling
File processing is separated into dedicated components
#### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The use of interfaces allows for extending functionality without modifying existing code
New file types can be added without changing the core file processing logic
The scheduler service can be extended to support new schedules without modifying existing code
#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Service implementations can be substituted with mock implementations in tests
The application context interface ensures that any implementation can be used interchangeably
#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces are specific to their use cases (e.g., IProductService, ICustomerService)
No evidence of "fat interfaces" that would force implementations to provide unnecessary methods
#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules (controllers, services) depend on abstractions (interfaces)
Low-level modules (data access) implement these abstractions
This allows for swapping implementations (e.g., for testing) without affecting business logic
### Additional Architectural Patterns
#### 1. MVC/Web API Pattern
Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses
Models represent domain entities
Services contain the business logic (replacing traditional "Controllers" in MVC)
#### 2. Unit of Work Pattern
ApplicationDbContext likely serves as a Unit of Work
Ensures that database operations are atomic and consistent
#### 3. Scheduler Pattern
SchedulerService implements a scheduling mechanism for file processing
Allows for configurable, time-based execution of tasks
### Testing Approach
The project demonstrates a comprehensive testing strategy:

- Unit Tests: Testing individual components in isolation (services, controllers)
- Integration Tests: Testing interactions between components
- Test Organization: Tests mirror the structure of the main codebase

### File Processing Architecture
The file processing component shows a well-designed approach to handling file-based integration:

- Configuration-Driven: Uses FileProcessingConfig and FileWatcherConfig for flexible configuration
- Parser Strategy: Different XML parsers for different file types
- Scheduled Processing: Uses a scheduler service for timed execution

## # Analysis of Libraries Used in GacWmsIntegrationProject

### Database Access

- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore: ORM for database access. **While ADO.NET would typically be preferred for performance-critical warehouse management systems due to its lower overhead and finer control over SQL queries, Entity Framework Core was chosen here for rapid development purposes**. In a production environment with high transaction volumes, a migration to optimized ADO.NET data access might be considered for better performance.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer: SQL Server provider for EF Core.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory: In-memory database provider for testing.

### Mapping and Data Transformation

- AutoMapper: Used for object-to-object mapping, likely transforming data between API models, domain models, and database entities.

### Testing

- Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk: Core testing infrastructure for .NET.
- MSTest.TestAdapter and MSTest.TestFramework: Microsoft's testing framework.
- Moq: Mocking framework for unit testing.

### Configuration and Hosting

- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration: Configuration framework.
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting and Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions: Generic host builder and abstractions.
### HTTP Communication

- Microsoft.Extensions.Http: HTTP client factory for creating HttpClient instances.
- Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly: Integration of Polly with HttpClientFactory.
- Polly: Resilience and transient-fault-handling library (retry policies, circuit breakers, etc.).

### Scheduling

- Quartz: Job scheduling library, used for background tasks or periodic integration jobs.

### Serialization

- Newtonsoft.Json: JSON serialization/deserialization library.
- Cronos: Library for parsing CRON expressions (likely used with Quartz for scheduling).

### Logging

- Serilog and related packages: Structured logging framework.
- Serilog.AspNetCore: Integration with ASP.NET Core.
- Serilog.Settings.Configuration: Configuration from appsettings.json.
- Serilog.Sinks.Console: Logging to console.
- Serilog.Sinks.File: Logging to files.

#### Table details
1. Customer Master Data - Stores basic customer information
2. Product Master Data - Stores product catalog information
3. Purchase Orders - Tracks inbound orders with customer reference
4. Purchase Order Details - Stores line items for purchase orders
5. Sales Orders - Tracks outbound orders with shipping information
6. Sales Order Details - Stores line items for sales orders
7. FileProcessingLog - Tracking the processing of XML files from legacy systems
8. WmsSyncLog - Monitoring the synchronization status with the GAC WMS

**Explanation of Database Design**

This simplified database design provides the essential structure for the GAC WMS Integration system:

**Master Data Tables:**

- CustomerMaster : stores information about clients utilizing GAC warehouse services

- ProductMaster :  contains the product catalog with basic information

Transaction Tables:

- PurchaseOrders and PurchaseOrderDetails : track inbound orders from ERP to WMS

- SalesOrders and SalesOrderDetails : track outbound orders from WMS to retail outlets

Operational Tables (recommended additions TODO):

- FileProcessingLog :  tracks the processing of XML files from legacy systems

- WmsSyncLog :  monitors the synchronization status with the GAC WMS

- SchedulerConfig :  manages the CRON-based scheduling for file polling

This structure supports both real-time API integration and file-based integration for legacy systems. The database will store all incoming data, allowing for validation, transformation, and synchronization with the GAC WMS.

#### 3. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine :

```
https://github.com/nehakushwahaeaton/GacWmsIntegration.git
cd GacWmsIntegration
```

#### 4. Cron Schedule Documentation

Cron jobs are scheduled at recurring intervals using a format based on Unix-cron. The schedule is defined using a string format consisting of five fields separated by spaces, indicating when the job should be executed. 

The fields are as follows:

- Minute (0-59): Specifies the minute of the hour when the job should run.
- Hour (0-23): Specifies the hour of the day when the job should run.
- Day of the month (1-31): Specifies the day of the month when the job should run.
- Month (1-12 or JAN-DEC): Specifies the month when the job should run.
- Day of the week (0-6 or SUN-SAT): Specifies the day of the week when the job should run.

The format is:

> \* * * * *

Each asterisk (*) can be replaced with a specific value or a range of values to define the schedule. Here are some examples:

- */1 * * * *: Runs every minute.
- 0 0 * * *: Runs at midnight every day.
- 0 12 * * MON: Runs at noon every Monday.
- 0 0 1 * *: Runs at midnight on the first day of every month.

#### 5. Update the file processing config's:
setup to be done in GacWmsIntegration.FileProcessor appsettings.json, and create DirectoryPath
```

    }
  ]
}

```

#### 6. Update the SQL connection string in appsettings.json:
setup to be done in GacWmsIntegration and GacWmsIntegration.FileProcessor appsettings.json
```
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=tcp:gacserverwarehouse.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=gacwmsdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=eatonadmin;Password=Qwertyuiop@12;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
}
```

#### 7. Running the API Host Project:
```
cd GacWmsIntegration/GacWmsIntegration
dotnet run
```
This will start the API Host project, which includes the Swagger and REST API.

#### 8. Running the File Processing Service:
Navigate to the GacWmsIntegration.FileProcessor directory and run the console application using the .NET CLI:
The ApiHealthCheckService will ensure, API's are running before any File processing begins, also the file execution will retry 5 time(configurable) before giving up.
```
cd GacWmsIntegration/GacWmsIntegration.FileProcessor
dotnet run
```
